# Production Runbook

## Release gates

The required `verify` check runs deterministic installation, lint, typecheck,
unit and PostgreSQL integration tests, production builds, and the three-role
Playwright smoke suite. Configure `verify` as a required status check on `main`.

Production requires:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET` with at least 32 characters
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default `8h`)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` as a comma-separated allowlist
- `REGISTRATION_INVITE_CODE` with at least 12 characters
- `ROOT_ADMIN_USERNAME` identifying the existing account to promote when the
  database does not yet have a ROOT_ADMIN

The API deliberately fails production startup when these security controls are
missing. Demo seeding is disabled when `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Session and browser-token policy

The closed-group MVP uses an expiring bearer token in browser local storage.
Tokens expire after eight hours by default and there is no silent renewal;
users sign in again. This accepts local-storage theft risk only for the MVP, so
the web deployment must use HTTPS, avoid third-party scripts, enforce a strict
Content Security Policy, and treat every XSS finding as a credential incident.
Moving to same-site, secure, HTTP-only cookies is the preferred next hardening
step before broad public distribution.

## Deployment

1. Build immutable API and web images from the verified Git SHA.
2. Back up the database.
3. Run `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy -w @ff-restaurent/api`, followed by
   `npm run prisma:cuisines:seed -w @ff-restaurent/api`, as one-time release
   jobs when the platform supports them. The cuisine seed is idempotent and
   never replaces the production catalog. Never run the destructive demo seed
   in production.
4. Deploy the API image, then verify `/health` and `/ready`.
5. Deploy the web image built with the production `VITE_API_URL`.
6. Run `npm run smoke` with staging URLs and a least-privileged smoke account.
7. Promote only when smoke checks and launch telemetry are healthy.

On container platforms without a pre-deploy job, the API Docker command runs
the same migration and cuisine-seed sequence before its existing idempotent
backfills and then uses `exec` to hand PID 1 to Node.

## Launch telemetry

Fastify request logs provide method, path, status, latency, and request IDs.
The API also emits structured events for `login_succeeded`, `bill_created`,
`payment_status_changed`, and `request_failure`. Alert on readiness failures,
repeated authentication failures/rate limits, and elevated 5xx responses.
Never log credentials, invite codes, JWTs, or request authorization headers.

## Backups and restore drills

Schedule provider-native encrypted daily backups with retention appropriate for
the group. The `Backup restore drill` workflow performs a weekly logical dump
from `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL`, restores it into an isolated temporary
PostgreSQL service, and verifies migration history. Restrict the workflow
environment and secret to approved operators.

Record each successful drill date, source snapshot, restored migration count,
duration, and operator in the release record. A failed drill blocks promotion.

## Rollback rehearsal

Before promotion, record the current API/web image digests and database backup.

1. Stop promotion and preserve failure logs and request IDs.
2. If the migration is backward-compatible, redeploy the previous API and web
   digests and run the staging smoke script.
3. If data restoration is required, stop writes, restore the pre-release
   backup into a new database, verify `_prisma_migrations` and row counts, then
   switch `DATABASE_URL` atomically.
4. Verify `/ready`, login, bill visibility, payment state, notifications, and
   role administration.
5. Document the incident and ship a forward migration; do not run `migrate dev`
   or manually delete production migration records.

The rollback is considered rehearsed when the prior images and a restored
database pass the staging smoke workflow without demo data.
